# mern-full-stack-dogs

This is an example of a full stack web list application using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Webpack. It is based on Sebastian Eschweiler's [tutorial](https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1), but has been modified.
l have only 1 server running. All the client side code will be bundled into static files using webpack and it will be served by the Node.js/Express application.

It allows the user to create a list of their favourite dogs. To the list can be added the group to which the breed belongs, along with the dogs temperament and the size of the dog. These features can all be edited at a later stage.
